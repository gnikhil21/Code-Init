# Complaint Filing System
This is a web application for students of NITC to book complaints about any problem they have. This makes it easier than to manually have to tell the problem.  

Stuednts have to create an account first and then they can register any complaint they have. The admin can view them and resolve their complaints accordingly.

Her's the overview of the web app:-
